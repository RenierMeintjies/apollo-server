> ðŸ“£ **Apollo Server 5 is [generally available](/resources/product-launch-stages#general-availability)!**

> If you are migrating from an older major version of Apollo Server, please follow the migration guides starting with your current version.
* [Migrate to Apollo Server 3](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v3/migration)
* [Migrate to Apollo Server 4](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v4/migration)

While Apollo Server v4 came with numerous breaking changes, the Apollo Server team is pleased to say that Apollo Server v5 comes with only two!

# Bumped Dependencies

## Node.js

Apollo Server 5 supports Node.js 16.14.0 and later. (Apollo Server 4 supports Node.js 14.16.0.) This includes all LTS and Current major versions at the time of release.

If you're using Node.js 14, upgrade your runtime before upgrading to Apollo Server 5.

(Apollo Server 5 specifically requires v16.14.0 instead of merely v16.0.0, because that is the minimum version of Node.js 16 supported by the [`lru-cache` dependency](https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache/commit/c237c1d64ebc2142da4f8324adb3ef300b0428bd), which makes use of `AbortController`.)

# Removed configuration option

## `status400ForVariableCoercionErrors`

This configuration option was introduced in Apollo Server v4.6.0 as a mitigation against a regression in v4. Apollo Server v4 mistakenly started responding with a 200 status code to requests with variable coercion errors. This configuration option restored the previous behavior (400 status code) when set to `true`.

Apollo Server v5 restores the original behavior (400 status code) as the default and removes the configuration option from its types. Leaving this option set will have no effect; you will simply receive a warning on startup informing you that it should be removed.
